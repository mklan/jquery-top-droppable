The `drop` event will trigger only once on drop and provides a reference to the foremost top-droppable element stored in `this`. You can still access `e` and `ui` and do stuff you would do with the native `drop` event of jQuery UI's `droppable` method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(\".top-droppable\").topDroppable({\r\n    drop: function (e, ui) {\r\n\t alert(\"dropped into \" + $(this).attr('id'));\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### use jQuery UI's droppable options and events\r\n\r\nYou can chain the `draggable` method to setup all the native options and events provided by jQuery UI:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(\".top-droppable\").topDroppable({\r\n    drop: function (e, ui) {\r\n\t alert(\"dropped into \" + $(this).attr('id'));\r\n    }\r\n}).droppable({\r\n    tolerance: \"pointer\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind not to use the native `drop` event.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### access the foremost element while dragging\r\n\r\nYou can access the currently foremost element while still dragging over the top-droppable elements with the following method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.getTopElement();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### access the currently hovering over top-droppable elements while dragging\r\n\r\nYou can access the top-droppable elements that you are currently hovering over with the following method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.getCurrentHoveredElements();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nCheck out the [example](https://github.com/vaceta/jquery-top-droppable/tree/master/example) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[Matthias Klan](https://github.com/vaceta/)\r\n\r\ncontact: matthias.klan@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Matthias Klan\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
